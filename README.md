# Vite example

Just a `vite` experiment

## Usage

Installing dependencies from [`package-lock.json`](package-lock.json):

```bash
$ npm install
```

Development environment (livereload included):

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Building the production bundle:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

Wanna check if everything is ok? Start a preview of the bundle:

```bash
$ npm run serve
```

## Further Notes

* Bundle files (JS) are not intentionally checked in the code base.
* Use [.devcontainer](.devcontainer) to exploit a Docker environment with VSCode remote, otherwise simply ignore it.
